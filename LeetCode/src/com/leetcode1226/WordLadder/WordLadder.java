/**
 * Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find
 * the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord,
 * such that:
 * 
 * Only one letter can be changed at a time. Each transformed word must exist in
 * the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word. For example,
 * 
 * Given: beginWord = "hit" endWord = "cog" wordList =
 * ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"] As one shortest transformation is "hit"
 * -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", return its length 5.
 * 
 * Note: Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence. All words have
 * the same length. All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters. You
 * may assume no duplicates in the word list. You may assume beginWord and
 * endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
